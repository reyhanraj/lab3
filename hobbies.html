                    <h3>Building Cars </h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a true passion of mine. It involves more than just mechanics, it’s about engineering, problem-solving and attention to detail. 
                        The process of taking something apart and putting it back together, often with improvements, is highly rewarding.

                    <h3>Rugby </h3>
                    <p>
                        Rugby is a fantastic team sport that requires discipline, endurance, and strategic thinking. 
                        It has taught me the value of teamwork, resilience, and pushing past physical limits, skills that are also applicable to software engineering challenges.
